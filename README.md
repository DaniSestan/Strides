## Description
This is project is currently in development. When I enrolled in the graduate program for Computer Science at the University of Colorado, I wanted to start a project that could align with some topic for my Master's thesis -- one that centers on sports analytics and big data.

I was inspired to develop a performance running app through my own experience with distance tracking applications that monitor my progress as a runner. Unlike these apps, the project I'm working goes beyond GPS tracking through a mobile device to record distance and speed. The app is being designed to also track the user's pace throughout the run, analyze that data, and provide personalized feedback on performance over time. 

When it comes to running, pacing _matters_ -- and this is common knowledge. Typically, runners who monitor pacing over the course of each run will then measure performance against general intensity guidelines for running. This manual approach fails to take into account specific metrics related to the runner and the course itself. It was after reading ['Effects of Pacing Properties on Performance in Long-Distance Running'](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/big.2018.0070?journalCode=big) that I gave more thought to the way pacing can be monitored and the conclusions that can be reached through data and analysis. At this stage in the project, I am currently working on a machine learning model that would be used in tracking running performance. As I continue to design and develop the application, I will be contributing to the repository and updating the README with an overview of my progress.
