## Description
This is project is currently in development. I'm currently enrolled in the graduate program for Computer Science at the University of Colorado, and would like to propose a Master's thesis that centers on sports analytics and big data. I've decided to develop this application in an attempt to analyze and research ideas related to this topic.

I was inspired to develop a performance running app, in part, through my own experience with distance tracking applications that monitor my progress as a runner. Unlike these apps, the project I'm working goes beyond GPS tracking through a mobile device to record distance and speed. I would like to be able to track the user's pace throughout the run, analyze the data, and provide useful feedback on the user's performance. 

When it comes to running, pacing _matters_ -- and this is common knowledge. Typically, runners and coaches monitor pacing over the course of each run and measure performance against general intensity guidelines for running. This manual approach fails to take into account specific metrics related to the runner and the course itself. It was after reading ['Effects of Pacing Properties on Performance in Long-Distance Running'](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/big.2018.0070?journalCode=big) that I gave more thought to the way pacing can be monitored and the conclusions that can be reached through data and analysis. At this stage in the project, I am currently working on a machine learning model that would be used in tracking running performance. As I continue to design and develop the application, I will be contributing to the repository and updating the README with an overview of my progress.
